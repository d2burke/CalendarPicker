# Calendar Picker

This is a scrollable Calendar Picker largly based on the work done by Roberto Bicchierai ([link](http://roberto.open-lab.com/2010/04/06/ultra-light-jquery-calendar/)) .

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.2+
2. CodeIgniter 2.1.0 to 3.0-dev

Note: for 1.7.x support download v2.2 from Downloads tab

## Usage

*This is a complete install of Codeigniter, which should probably be built as a module or spark

1. Add 'afterburner' to your included folders in the .htaccess file in the root of your app
2. Edit the database connection info
3. Either run APP_URL/setup/database to install the tables or use 'ab_backup.sql' file to create the tables (copy paste the SQL into your query editor or phpmyadmin to create the tables)
4. APP_URL/afterburner/create - Create topic areas and add documentation items to those areas
with a simple and easy to use Richtext editor.  The typical Codeigniter User Guide styles
are available.
